# Minecraft-Injector-java-
The DLL is injected into Minecraft by the injector using manual mapping. By allocating memory in the target process, putting the DLL into that memory, and changing the process' entry point to the DLL's loader, it avoids using more conventional techniques like CreateRemoteThread. In order to reroute function calls to the custom functions of the injected DLL, it also hooks the Import Address Table (IAT).
